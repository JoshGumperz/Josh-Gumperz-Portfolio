                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Josh Gumperz, I'm 20 years old and I'm an aspiring software developer. I chose to pursue a career in software development because the tech industry has been a passion of mine for pretty much as long as I can remember. I grew up around computers and tech, even built my own computer when I was 15. After graduating high school, I knew I wanted to work in the tech industry, but I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. So I took an IT training class which taught me how to troubleshoot and repair computers. I learned a lot as an IT student, but utlamitely decided it wasn't for me, and I would rather do software development instead. Since then, I've done some self training using resources such as CodeAcademy, before eventually commiting to do a coding bootcamp this year. I'm now working towards my long term goal of becoming a software developer.</p>
